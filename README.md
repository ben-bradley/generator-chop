# generator-chop [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ben-bradley/generator-chop.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ben-bradley/generator-chop)

> A Gulp, Hapi, SocketIO, React, Bootstrap app generator.

> VERY much in development.

## Chop

This generator will spin up an app that leverages the following tools:

- Gulp
- Hapi
- React
- SocketIO

## Ideas

It would be cool if I could get this to integrate with HAM.  That shouldn't be too difficult with the plugin architecture...

Chop apps are designed to spin up a full-stack app quickly and streamline development by making some choices for you.
